<h1><i>"5 Best Traditional Diwali Decorations"</i></h1>
<p>
<b><h3>The brightest festival of the year, Diwali is here! Diwali preparations start at least a month before with cleaning of the homes.</h3></b>After the decluttering, people begin with their festive shopping of buying God Idols for the pooja, Diwali gifts for their dear ones, new clothes, sweets. And, the last thing in the Diwali preparations is Diwali decoration.

On the occasion of Diwali, houses are decorated to welcome Goddess Lakshmi and Lord Ganesha for prosperity. Homes are also decorated because, on this day, Lord Ram along with Sita and Lakshman, came to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile. In their honour, the Ayodhyavaasi decorated their abodes beautifully.

With the sublime thought of helping you, we are going to share with you some traditional Diwali decorations to prep your home for the sparkling festivity.
